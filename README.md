Document Similarity Detection Using MinHash and Locality-Sensitive Hashing
This repository contains a tool for calculating the similarity between two DOCX documents using MinHash-based approximate Jaccard similarity. The project utilizes shingling to tokenize text, generates MinHash signatures, and provides an intuitive web interface built with Gradio for document comparison. It is ideal for tasks like plagiarism detection, version comparison, and content clustering.

Features:

Text extraction from DOCX files.
Shingling-based tokenization.
Efficient similarity computation using MinHash.
User-friendly Gradio interface.
