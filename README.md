# Document Similarity Detection Using MinHash and Locality-Sensitive Hashing

This repository provides a tool for comparing the similarity between two DOCX documents using MinHash-based approximate Jaccard similarity. The project uses shingling for text tokenization, generates MinHash signatures, and offers a user-friendly web interface built with Gradio for seamless document comparison.

## Features
- Extracts text from DOCX files.
- Tokenizes text using shingling.
- Computes efficient similarity using MinHash.
- Provides an intuitive Gradio interface for interaction.

## Demo
Try the project on [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Sourikta/doc_similarity).
